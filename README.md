* ## __Description__: This is a project to create a new program language with compiler, linker and debugger.
* ## __Core purpose__: In order to study compiler principles and improve my programming skills, I refer to major mainstream C/C++ compilers(like clang, LLVM, gcc) to create a compiler for my own language.
* ## __TODO__: *☆ In these three month, I will finish the [grammar](/Grammar/first.md). And finish the basic lexical analysis.*

# **☆☆☆ Because I am a middle school student, I have very little time, so the process will be slow.**
